# DUIManhunt

A modification of Dig It Up were "runners" try to speedrun and beat the game before "hunters" kill them, inspired from "Minecraft Manhunt". You can damage other players by swinging your pickaxe at them. All players in game must have the plugin. Most things are configurable in the plugin settings.
